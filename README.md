# DFRobot MQ7 Carbon Monoxide Data Logging
The repo name speaks for itself.  Use this code if you wish to collect MQ7 analog (non-discrete) data and log to CSV files.  Was tested recently and works, at least with an Arduino Uno R3 board.

Collates code from [FeifeiDeakin/MotionDataLogging: MotionDataLogging](https://github.com/FeifeiDeakin/MotionDataLogging), [Carbon_Monoxide_Gas_Sensor_MQ7___SKU_SEN0132_](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Carbon_Monoxide_Gas_Sensor_MQ7___SKU_SEN0132_), [Code Walkthrough | Adafruit Data Logger Shield | Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-data-logger-shield/using-the-real-time-clock-3) and [adafruit/Light-and-Temp-logger](https://github.com/adafruit/Light-and-Temp-logger).
